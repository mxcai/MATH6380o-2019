Peer review for group 3

Summary:
i. Feature Extraction
Briefly discuss some 'steps' in the extraction process.
ii. Feature Visualization
Implement tsne to both ResNet and scattering net.
iii. Image classification
accuracy of various classifcation methods is listed.

Strength:
Detailed analysis between various classification methods. Concrete eplainations are given and it is inspiring.

Weakness:
Too little visualizattion method method. I look forward to see comparsion between various methods and whyu some methods are better than others.
Maybe can list out the feature map of scattering network and VGG19 in feature extraction part.
