• Summary of the report.
The authors did experiment on Raphael paintings dataset by Prof. Yang Wang from HKUST.
They performed data augmentation by cropping squares with different sizes from original images.
Then they used Scattering Net and ResNet to extract features and predicted using traditional machine learning and deep learning methods.

The original dataset is small, they did data augmentation to enhance the data.

• Describe the weaknesses of the report.
Might do some validation on the models.
