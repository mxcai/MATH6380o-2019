1. The validation results are given in line chart: the lower, orange line. We apologize that we miss the exact setting: the train-dev split on the augmented 23k dataset is by 8:2.
2. It is stated in the "Prediction" section that "Predicted probabilities of whether the corresponding sample is Raphael are shown in the Table", so the numbers in table are the confidences given by the classifier that each of the 7 disputed samples is genuine. So the results could be interpreted as that the classifier is somehow confident that sample 20 is fraud, but has limited confidence on other images.
3. The ScatNet results are under different settings and presented by Mean Square Error (MSE) as mentioned in the table, so the numbers could not be directly compared.
