Report 7
• Summary of the report.
This report uses different methods of feature extraction and visualization on the MNIST dataset and Raphael's paintings dataset. The results and experiments are clearly stated, and the features are presented well. However, it seems that this report is mostly methods introduction and progress representation. It lacks some kinds of analyzation. It seems that this reports uses many methods in visualization but only one in classification. I think they can use several methods and compare their results, so that they may discover something new.
