Peer review for group 7

Summary:
i. Feature Extraction
The group implement feature extraction on MNIST by scattering network and on Raphael's paintings by VGG19. Examples of feature map are presented on both dataset.
ii. Feature Visualization
The group implement six methods in total, ranging from PCA, MDS,LLE  e.t.c. Scattering plot are presented and above methods are carefully analysised and compared.
iii. Image classification
SVM model is implemeted on both MNIST and Raphael painting dataset.

Strength:
The report have a very wide coverage, covering 6 method in feature visalization and two datasets. Each datasets have been carefully taken care.
I especially appreciate the feature map part as a few maps on both datasets have been shown.
The scatter plot in feature visualization part is good too as the distribution of points are carefully discussed.


Weakness:
On the feature visualization part, the group only focus on describing how the points are scatted in the scatter plot on different methods. With the decription of each method introduced beforehand, I expect to see explainations why a certain method will make a better/worse result. (e.g. non-linear structure of data??)
Maybe some more classification method if more time is allowed.
