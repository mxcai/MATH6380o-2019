Report 12
• Summary of the report.
This report uses three methods to do feature extraction and two methods to do visualization. They also uses several methods to do classification. They show that LDA with features from scattering nets get the best performance, but the analyzations are not that sound.
• Describe the strengths of the report.
Clear features and tables. Nice explanation on the methods they use.
• Describe the weaknesses of the report.
Lack of analyzation in there results.
• Evaluation on Clarity and quality of writing (1-5):
3. This report is clearly written. However, I think that they use too much space to introduce different methods. I think the focus should be on their own results.
• Evaluation on Technical Quality (1-5):
3. They do some comparisons on experiments, but they do not provide plausible analyzation.
• Overall rating: 
3
• Confidence on your assessment (1-3)
