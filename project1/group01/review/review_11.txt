• Summary of the report.
This report experimented on MNIST dataset. 
The authors used wavelet scattering transform as data augmentation to achieve data augmentation. 
They used Scattering Net for feature extraction, and visualized the features using PCA and t-SNE. 
For classification, they used various non-deep-learning methods including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.
They also tried deep learning models including AlexNet, VGG19 and ResNet18.
Finally, they used 3-Fold Cross Validation to validate the above models.

• Describe the strengths of the report.
They tried various models and did evaluations on them.

• Describe the weaknesses of the report.
Maybe more details about the hyperparameters can be given for the models.

• Evaluation on Clarity and quality of writing (1-5): 5

I guess in the Feature Extraction part, "we implement the 2D scatting transform" should be "we implement the 2D scattering transform"


• Evaluation on Technical Quality (1-5): 5
