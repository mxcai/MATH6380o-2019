"Also, I suggest the author could just briefly introduce the basic ideas of the referred methods (VAE, GAN, Dilated CNN, etc.) and be more focused on their own contribution, as the details of their work are not thoroughly presented."    
Since the audience of the report are students in our class, we have to find the balance between making people understand the general approach (which was not covered in class) and going into the details of our implementation. All code and data files are available for the interested reader (see section 8 in the report). Furthermore, review of literature was part of our project, since we mostly did not study the approaches we used before.
"Though multiple methods are used, the results are not well analyzed: reasons for results should be discussed. Also, classical methods for time-series prediction (ARIMA, etc.) should be referred as baselines."
The models are largely black box, so interpretation is difficult. Using classical models is a nice suggestion. However, since we're limited by 8 pages, this probably would have had the consequence of not implementing one of the other models.
