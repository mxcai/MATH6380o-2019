"Lack of vizualization"
We built our models from scratch and didn't prioritize visualizations
"Seems just use dataset rather then apply deep learning methods"
Not true, we extracted features using VAE and GAN both of which are deep learning methods. Signatures of rough path is a more classical approach. 
"The result is resonable but not useful, the feature extraction did not improve the precise of the result"
Feature extraction using VAE and signatures actually gave improvements in prediction accuracy, just the GAN features failed to work. Furthermore running a Dilated CNN on the raw data did not find any structure in the data either. Unlike for images where there's a clear structure to be captured financial data is notoriously difficult to predict. Obtining accuracies of 60% can generate profits after fees.  
"The python file lack visualization part and contains only feature extraction. It may be hard for others to replicate"
The full code and data is avaliable under the link in section 8 of the report.
"The result is not strong enough to support the work"
Unlike for images where theres is a clear structure to be captured, financial data is notoriously difficult to predict. Obtaining accuracies of 60% can generate profits after fees.
