Peer review for group 4


Summary
- introduce stationary principle
- intoduce and train WGAN-GP
- introduce signature of rough path, a machine learning feature extraction technique. Approach is explained clearly.
- introduce variational autoencoder.
- implementation in LSTM and dilated CNN

Strength
- introdunction of the inspriing 'signature of rough path' methiod. Clear, short but simple explaination is given. I really appreciate how the writes go around the challenge of missing data and high dimensional raw data.
- Although dilated CNN is not successful, the result leaves impact on myself personally as for me it is kind of brand new stuff. I really appreciate yoir worlk on trying to combine it with GAN too.
