Peer review for group 5

summary
Briefly introduce meta learning and few shot learning. Then the write implement the algorithm to multiple classification tasks in which shot number and performance is investigated.
Effect of inner loop learning rate, meta learning rate, number of stages and a few more things are investigated too.
Finally the write further introduce strategies to improve MAML and investigate each of their performance.

Strength
This paper gives a very all rounded experiements on different aspects of meta learning. The 10 experiments are inspiring and well thought/designed. They allow people to have a deeper understanding to its mechanism.
