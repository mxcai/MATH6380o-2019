Peer review for group 6

Summary:
i. Feature Extraction
Mathematical analysis of scattering network is presented.
Architecture of VGG 19 is shown.
ii. Feature Visualization
Implement TSNE on features extracted by scattering net and VGG 19 respectively.
iii. Image classification
Logistic regression/stochastic gradient descent is used for classification.

Strength:
Formulas of scattering networks are well derived.
Give explaination on why tsne leads to a better visualization result. 

Weakness:
Too little visualizattion method and classification method. I look forward to see comparsion between various methods and whyu some methods are better than others.
Maybe can list out the feature map of scattering network and VGG19 in feature extraction part.
