• Summary
MNIST classification based on ScatNet and VGG16 as feature extractor.

• Strength
The report is self-contained and clearly written. The work is satisfiable.

• Weakness
Some minor issues could be found in the paper.

• Evaluation on Clarity and quality of writing: 5
The report is well-written, with points of concerns provided clearly.
The number of samples in 1 seems to be a typo.

• Evaluation on Technical Quality: 4
The results are well-supported, while it would be better if more models are evaluated and the results are further analyzed. Also it should be noticed that "impossible to use a linear classiﬁer" in 5 is not exact as tSNE is only a manner of projection towards the 2D plane.

• Overall rating: 4

• Confidence: 3
